> I am Amaan Shaik. I do not claim any expertise. I am not a very skilled person, — at least not yet. This blog marks a starting point where I put everything I learn in public. Some may find this unusual, but I’ve realised something about myself that I work better when my progress is visible and being watched by someone. It keeps me accountable, focused, and away from all the distractions. So that’s the reason why I chose to document what I learn — not to showcase or flex something.

## for recruiters

If you’re a recruiter or someone evaluating my profile, this blog is meant to give context beyond a resume. I use this space to document how I learn, what I work on, and how my thinking evolves over time. You’ll find learning notes, small projects, exam prep, a ton mistakes, and reflections. all written as they happen, no AI generated slop. I don’t claim to have everything figured out yet. What I do offer is a discipline, consistency and an intent to stay productive.

# how it all started

i’ve always been curious about tech since the school. back in the 8th grade, i discovered IoT projects. My first micro controller was an Arduino Uno, which my father bought for me, shoutout to him. i felt genuinely interested in experimenting with tech.

at that time, i didnt even own a computer. so i had to rely on rented computer cabins at a local internet center to install arduino ide and compile the C code i used to copy from forums and youtube. sometimes i used to write the code on paper and use the school computer because the internet centers thought i was doing some shady stuff.

nonetheless, that curiousity stayed with me through school. in 11th grade, i finally got access to an old desktop computer at home. and by 12th grade i began exploring linux systems. i experimented with different distributions, dealt with broken audio drivers, system errors, and configuration issues but i slowly began how operating systems, hardware and software work together.

during this period, around january 2023 i started using ChatGPT. it was very new, it was just a month later after its release when i got to use it.

## college, experiments, and poor decisions

i later joined a BBA Business Analytics program. Alongside academics, i spent time reading about business, data and tech, and experimented with entrepreneural ideas outside classroom. i attempted to build a student community to improve peer engagement and later tried a small, frugal business consulting idea with friends.

not all of these worked.

some lost interest, others failed at execution. but each attempt helped me understand teamwork and how to properly communicate and the gap between on paper ideas and ground zero adoption.

in paralell, i continued experimenting on my own — setting up a server at home, exploring VMs and learning how modern systems are built.

## where i am now

right now, i started thinking about my career ahead as the final year started getting close to an end.

i shifted my focus to building a good resume and a clear career goal. i am actively learning Python, preparing for the DP-600 exam, which i earned a waiver for through Microsoft Fabric Data Days.

i lost hope on my college’s campus placements as they are unable to get us relevant roles. so the only way for me is through direct, cold approach and refferals.

## why this blog exists

this blog exists to document that process honestly. i will use it to share what i learn, what works, what doesn’t and how my thinking evolves over time.

### few acknowledgements

along the way i’ve learned a lot through conversations with people who were kind to share their experiences.

[Mani Raj](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yeluri-mani-raj-1684ab24a/) and [Jahnavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jahnavi-dulla1404/) gave me an idea of how they got into corporate roles and what they do.

i’d also like to acknowledge [Akshaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaya-thummalapally-764aa5308/) and [Dinesh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dineshacc/), with whom i drafted ideas around business and consulting small businesses, even if it didn’t work out the way we initally expected.

finally, i appreciate [Dr. G. Sumanth Kumar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-g-sumanth-kumar-78a592236/), the former dean of my campus, for being open to the student community intiatives and the discussions early on.
