> I am Amaan Shaik. I do not claim any expertise. I am not a very skilled person, — at least not yet. This blog marks a starting point where I put everything I learn in public. Some may find this unusual, but I’ve realised something about myself that I work better when my progress is visible and being watched by someone. It keeps me accountable, focused, and away from all the distractions. So that’s the reason why I chose to document what I learn — not to showcase or flex something.

## for recruiters

If you’re a recruiter or someone evaluating my profile, this blog is meant to give context beyond a resume. I use this space to document how I learn, what I work on, and how my thinking evolves over time. You’ll find learning notes, small projects, exam prep, a ton mistakes, and reflections. all written as they happen, no AI generate slop. I don’t claim to have everything figured out yet. What I do offer is a discipline, consistency and an intent to stay productive.

# how it all started

i’ve always been curious about tech since the school. back in the 8th grade, i discovered IoT projects. My first micro controller was an Arduino Uno, which my father bought for me, shoutout to him. i felt genuinely interested in experimenting with tech.

at that time, i didnt even own a computer. so i had to rely on rented computer cabins at a local internet center to install arduino ide and compile the C code i used to copy from forums and youtube. sometimes i used to write the code on paper and use the school computer because the internet centers thought i was doing some shady stuff.

nonetheless, that curiousity stayed with me through school. in 11th grade, i finally got access to an old desktop computer at home. and by 12th grade i began exploring linux systems. i experimented with different distributions, dealt with broken audio drivers, system errors, and configuration issues but i slowly began how operating systems, hardware and software work together.

during this period, around january 2023 i started using ChatGPT. it was very new, it was just a month later after its release when i got to use it.
