a large part of my learning this week came from a long microsoft fabric tutorial by [ansh lamba](https://www.youtube.com/@AnshLambaJSR), nearly 9 hours in total.

i also activated a microsoft fabric trial, which comes with a $100 credit for 60 days. that finally let me use fabric instead of just watching tutorials

luckily i have an extra monitor so i just set up tutorial on one side, fabric open on the other, and follow the instructor.

there were some hiccups. the tutorial was recorded a year ago when fabric was still in preview. now that it’s fully rolled out, few things have changed, which slowed me down with getting familiar.

while studying lakehouses and warehouses, i got some clarity on what actually seperates data engineers from other data roles. that alone cleared some confusion i was having.

this week didnt produce much output. but i didnt want to break the habit of documenting just because progress wasnt presentable.

the chart below is a google trends comparision of search interest for “data analyst” vs “data engineer”.

it gave me a rough idea of how data landscape has shifted over a span of two decades.

i also experimented with Datawrapper to create the embedded visualization you see above.

i had to compare the search terms and pull the data from [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/), and loaded it onto [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/) and applied some tweaks and embedded it in here.

i was hesitant to write today because i didnt have anything polished to show but i just want to be consistent with the commitment i made to document my learnings.
