this year was messed up. i tried a lot of things, some worked, most didn’t.

i created a [brand kit](https://www.behance.net/iamaanshaik) for a water bottle business some students at my college were starting.

i desgined presentations for classmates who had case studies due.

and i build a presentation that i actually presented to my college administration pointing out their [mistakes](https://1drv.ms/p/c/655497a96de9266f/IQDd1OffWJX9Q5CXjXMxQrnEAcVR9NsoaphDkA44q3qXIJ8?e=r387gf).

they princpal heard me out. nothing changed, but atleast i tried.

### the good boy’s kitchen

i came across an internship opening at a hyderabad based dog food startup called [The Good Boy Kitchen](https://goodboy.kitchen/)

i wanted that role badly. so instead of just submitting a resume, i went out and did some [field research](https://1drv.ms/p/c/655497a96de9266f/IQD2D4DHK3axR6S_QRgqK4kQAUow8pwb3IvAZPibcSeyYn8?e=yetdAs).

i visited pet stores across the city and also collected their business cards. i submitted all of this.

i didn’t get the internship.

### an iot experiment i didn’t finish

half way through the year, i started working on an IoT productivity tracker.

idea was simple: track everything. from waking up to going to bed. i built a prototype using an ESP32 board, wired it up, copied code from chatgpt and got it partially functional.

then exams hit, then other commitments piled up. and the project got shelved.

i’m not great at finishing things.

### the placement letter

by the end of year it became clear that our college’s placement program was fundamentally broken.

out of 15 companies that visited

* 10 offered sales
    
* 4 offered customer support roles
    
* 1 offered accounting role
    

none of them were relevant to us, none of them required a business analytics degree. these roles aren’t worth spending 3 years in college.

so i drafted a formal complaint letter. 12 other classmates signed it with me. we submitted it to the placement cell and principal.

i knew we won’t see any change. but at least we wanted to do say it out.

### what i didn’t talk about

2025 was also the hardest year of my life personally.

i lost my uncle.

my dad was hospitalized. there were weeks where i couldnt focus on anything.

i don’t want to dwell on it too much here, but i’m mentioning it because it’s a part of why this year felt so scattered. i was trying to stay productive, while everything was falling apart.

### what about 2026

2026 going to be my reset.

i’m done experimenting with random things. i’m narrowing my mind towards skills, learning to code, building open-source projects and more.

hoping to find some good work and becoming financially independent.

most importantly, maintaining a good relationship with people. i need to talk more to people instead of texting.

eating healthy, staying in shape, having a good sleep cycle and some mental clarity will be one of the top priorties from now.
